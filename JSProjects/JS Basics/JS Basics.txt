Comparison Operators
<    Less than
>   Greater than
<=  Less than or equal to
>= Greater than or equal to
==    equal to
!=     not equal to

There are also "strict" equality types
=== same value and same type
!== not same value and same type

For example:
"2" == 2 will be true - even though they're different types, they're considered equal
"2" === 2 will be false because the second value is a number type, where the first is a string type
You should use the triple === whenever possible, as it's more specific.
